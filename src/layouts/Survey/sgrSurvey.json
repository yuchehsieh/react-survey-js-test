    "description": "This questionnaire is designed to help us learn much more about how your breathing is troubling you and how it affects your life. We are using it to find out which aspects of your illness cause you most problems, rather than what the doctors and nurses think your problems are. Please ask if you have difficulty understanding the questions. Do not spend too long deciding about your answers. ",
